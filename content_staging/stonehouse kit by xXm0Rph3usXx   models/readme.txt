For reference look into the map, if u do not know how big to make some of the models.
this pack is mostly using ingame textures, the other imported ones dont need any path, 
just delete the "war3imported\".

If u use this in your map, plz give credits to:

 xXm0RpH3usXx - idea and modeling
 Chriz.        - for those fuckin good animations
 Shadow1500   - helping with naming the animations and triggering

When taking over this system one has to copy the triggers, if not triggered by the mapmaker himself,
and name the doodads and destructibles the same way.
Leave doodads and destructibles the way they are unless you are sure that what you do will not
interfere with the systems if you use them.
Every building you build has to have the already existing tiles as ground and do not delete the
tiles underneath the carpet, the trigger making the roof disappear relies on that the unit stand on one
of the them.




The map features following:

   - walls, doors and windows (animated)

   - edges and corners to fill the gap between the walls

   - roofs/chimney and extra windows on the roof (animated)

   - tiles, basically planes wiht a tiling texture

   - carpet system, four different tiles which, placed logically, will end as one carpet in the end

   - misc stuff such as a torch, a bank, stairs and two pillar variations

   - fully walkable stairs, since they are destructibles and "walkable" is ticked
