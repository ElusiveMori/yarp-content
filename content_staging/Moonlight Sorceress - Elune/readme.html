<h2>Description</h2>
<p>@Rence Kristoff asked me to make a nice Night Elf Sorceress and enchance the one he saw. And I decided to make this one.<br />
<br />
Could be Elune in her young days. (Yes... I dunno nothing about her nor her life...and yes...that&#039;s Soraka&#039;s Moon-Banana Staff)<br />
<br />
<i><b>Alternative Lore: </b>&quot;In her young days, Elune always as fascinated by the Moon and its arcane magic. Different from her sisters that were more Warrior-like. Her hard study lead her to a inner knowledge. Such knowledge defended her home in the first invasion of the Burning Legion, where Sargeras himself led the siege.<br />
<br />
With a mighty call Elune summoned the High Moon to blast her enemies. Sargeras fleet in fear while injured. Since that day Elune was proclamed the Moonlight Goddess.&quot;<br />
<br />
